# Linux Directory Permission

So the permission bits have different meaning when applying to the directories.

* **READ**: Allows the affected user to list the files within the directories.
* **WRITE**: Allows the affected user to create, rename, delete the files if the execute bit is set too.
* **EXECUTE**: Allows the affected use to enter the directory.
